Changes in Go4 v5.0.x
1. One can register Start/Stop/Clear commands in any place of THttpServer hierarchy.
   Such commands recognized by the GUI and used when pressing Start/Stop analysis buttons
   or Clear analysis objects button 
2. Allow to use graphics in analysis. With "-gr" or "-graphics" option one enable ROOT graphics.
   User can create and update canvas or any other TG... object.
3. Support Python Scripting in analysis, either by GUI Analysis terminal command line or in compiled code: 
   A leading '$' in command line will execute python script of given name, occasonally TGo4Analysis object 
   is bound as go4 symbol. New Methods  ExecuteLine and ExecutePython in TGo4Analysis and TGo4EventProcessor to 
   invoke regular interpreter commands and python scripts,resp, from compiled code. File search dialog of 
   Analysis terminal in GUI will provide also file filters for *.py macros. 
   Thanks to Sven Augustin, MPI Heidelberg, for this idea and code support.   
4. Support Python Scripting in GUI command line (TGo4AbstractInterface binding). File search dialog of GUI
   commandline tool will provide also file filters for *.py macros. 
5. Analysis terminal window: added button to scroll down to end of output text.
6. Web GUI: Implemented analysis terminal window with macro command line (requires ROOT>=5.34.34)
7. TGo4Style Color Tool: Added selection menu to provide new ROOT6 named palettes.
   New entry "Settings/Panel defaults/Palette settings" to specify minimum and maximum valid ROOT palette indices for spinbox,
   and default palette index.



Changes in Go4 v5.0.0
1. GUI Settings/Preferences: Added configurable window resize/move mode ("rubberband" outline or full repaint). 
   Reduces window flickering with current Qt5.x versions due to non compressed X-events
2. Workarounds in qtroot interface for Qt5: to avoid known bug with non compressed X mouse events
   (https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-40889), introduced 100ms time limit for processing mouse move events 
   in QRootCanvas. This improves canvas interaction performance significantly.
3. GUI can connect to go4analysis with either HTTP server or go4 sockets with "Connect to server" button. HTTP server
   provides same functionality as Go4 sockets connection and besides shows remote terminal output in the analysis window.
   Access to web server (controller/observer roles) can be controlled by htdigest accounts and password
4. GUI can start go4analysis as HTTP server with Launch Analysis button. 
   This provides  now an alternative mode to the established Go4 sockets analysis server.
5. TGo4FileStore: implement to change tree flush threshold (autosave interval) in GUI configuration. 
   Set default tree flush threshold to 10000 events. Due to changed ROOT API, positive numbers
   indicate number of events, negative number of bytes to flush tree into file. Was historically set to a large number (of bytes)
   so practically tree was never flushed until end of analysis.
6. Add doxygen documentation generation to Makefile. Now "make docs" will produce doxygen html output in subdirectory docs/doxygen.   
        


Changes in Go4 v4.7.1
1. Implement TGo4Parameter::UpdateFromUrl() method to be able change
   parameter values via HTTP server.
2. Provide several shortcuts in web interface for commands like:
   "Start", "Stop", "Clear", "Resubmit"
3. In batch mode do not account events in non-running mode, reduce
   cpu load with sleep in non-running mode. 
4. Introduce go4.js with go4-related JavaScript code
5. Provide html-based condition and parameter editors
6. Support access to ROOT-based http server from go4 GUI. 
   Just when staring go4, specify:
      [shell]  go4 http://localhost:8080
7. Added new condition type TGo4ShapedCond. This is subclass of TGo4Polycond with properties
   to create ellipse/circle/box-shaped polygon region from center/radius/tilt parameters. Supported by
   new registration methods MakeEllipseCond, MakeCircleCond, MakeBoxCond in TGo4Analysis and TGo4EventProcessor.
   Condition editor in qt4 GUI has a tab to manipulate these conditions interactively.
   Thanks to Sven Augustin, MPI Heidelberg, for this idea.        
8. When file opened in Go4, sub-directory will be read only after
   actively clicked. Allow read large ROOT files.  
    

Changes in Go4 v4.7.0
1. Store main window geometry and toolboxes settings in hotstart (only qt4).
   Makes possible to reproduce exactely view of the main panel. 
2. In go4-config script provide --cflags, --libs and --glibs option.
   This should allow to build libraries and executables, which are using
   go4 libraries.    
3. When taking ROOT objects from DABC-based application, also request and
   unpack list of streamer infos. This allow to browse and display objects 
   with different class version.
4. Improve handling of superimposed graphs and histograms: support
   time axis, correctly set colors, adjust size of legends box.
5. Use MSG_NOSIGNAL option when send/recv data via socket (only for Unix).
   Allows to correctly terminate analysis when socket corrupted or broken.
6. Activate graphics editor (TGedEditor) when called via context menu.
   Was not working due to recent ROOT changes.      
7. In web-browser allow to explore parameter and events objects, registered
   in the analysis. Hide unsupported types.
8. Add support of fastcgi. Now go4 can deliver its data to standard 
   web server (like Apache or lighttpd). This allows to control access rights
   and security with usual methods, provides by web-servers.    
9. Use QMdiArea instead of obsolete QWorkspace, solves several small
   problems in window management. 
10.To provide full support of ROOT6 one dictionary per go4 library 
   will be created. Exclude dictionary generation for gui classes while
   no libraries with qt classes exists. 
11.Mostly complete porting to ROOT6 and Qt5.
12.Introduce UserPreLoop() and UserPostLoop() methods in TGo4EventProcessor.
   One can use such methods without creation of specialized analysis class. 
13.Implement TGo4Analysis::GetInputFileName() - returns currently processed 
   file name. Automatically reset TGo4Analysis::IsNewInputFile() at the end
   of event processing. 
14.Introduce Go4ExampleDabc, which shows usages of DABC functionality in Go4.
   Example shows how one can regularly submit commands to running MBS. 
15.Support -std=c++11, which is now used in ROOT6.
16.By default all objects appear in gui with monitor flag. 
   Only monitoring should be started to get any histogram/graph monitored. 
17.Bugfix concerning autoscale in multipad viewpanel.
18.Changed some histogram definitions in Go4ExampleUserSource, added angular distribution. 
   Now covers different scenarios of multiple scattering simulation SCATT2014.     
              

Changes in Go4 v4.6.0 (November 2013)
1. Start implementation of new communication interfaces in Go4. Therefore
   change of version number. Aim to make fast 4.6 release and than 5.0 till
   end of 2013.
2. Start implementing direct channel to DABC. For the moment only optional.
3. With use of DABC classes http server to go4analysis is introduced. 
   Just add "-http 8090" arguments to start web server, which can deliver 
   all go4 objects to browser! 
4. Also with DABC classes provide possibility to optionally connect with
   DABC master node, which can export go4 data via http server. By this
   data from many go4 analysis can be agregated in the same server!     
5. To get different DABC functionality to go4, one need to compile go4
   with "make withdabc=1" flag. One should use newest dabc version from
   repository.
6. Provide go4 analysis view in web browser like in go4gui. 
7. In analysis Launch Panel one can specify arguemtns to start http server
   or to connect with master DABC application.
8. In Go4ExampleAdvanced show possibility to recreate histograms with different
   ranges. It could be used when only when in running analysis one could decide
   which histograms ranges should be created.
9. In TGo4FitSlot add possibility to clear object. Necessary when old object
   was already destroyed - older TGo4FitSlot::SetObject method tried to cast
   old object. Use it when set histograms or graphs to slot objects.
10.Provide configurable timeout in hotstart script for time when alalysis configuration
   is submited. It can be longer as default 20 sec, which now can be changed.
11.Add possibility to refresh names list after analysis configuration. Can be used
   if shortly after analysis start new histograms are created, whcih should be
   shown in the gui. For that one need to add following lines to the hitstart:
       go4->Wait(10);   
       go4->RefreshNamesList();
   First wait defines how long one need to guarantee, that analysis starts.    
12.Fix problem with zoom selection - at some time in ROOT TAxis::SetRangeUser
   was modified, which leads to zoom shift on one bin every histogram update.
   Fixed for qt4 version of GUI.
13.In all go4 source files use std:: prefix for standard libraries. 
14.Small adjustments for newest ROOT 5.99 version.
15.Introduce TGo4AnanlysisSniffer class, which could obtain some Go4 events like
   ratemeter update or status message sending. Use in Go4Dabc sniffer to provide
   such information to the browser.  
16.Provide all status messages to TGo4AnanlysisSniffer to be able show all of them
   in the browser.
17.TGo4Log can deliver all messages to special sniffer object. This message
   is used in TGo4DabcSniffer to record and provide debug output of any go4 analysis
18.Provide in preference menu possibility to set "draw once" flag. Means every histogram
   can only be drawn once when double-clicked in the browser.
19.Provide in gui script possibility to request item name, drawn in the panel.
   Method name is go4->GetDrawnItemName(panel, cnt = 0). Can be useful in some 
   gui scripts. Done for qt3/qt4. 
20.Fix problem with TGo4FileSource and newest ROOT - SetBranchAddress was not working
   correctly.
21.Special proxy created for access to running dabc application via dabc socket.
   Idea to have similar look and fill like web-based interface, but with 
   native ROOT graphics. 
22.Support of connection to dabc in gui and hotstart (qt4)
23.When TGraph with time on X axis drawn for the first time, it will be correctly 
   recognized in the view panel.
24.Add commands like start/stop analysis and clear histograms into web interface.


Changes in Go4 v4.5.5
1. Adjust different macros to use together with ROOT 5.99 
2. Implement auto-zoom functionality for 1/2/3-dim histogram (qt3/qt4).
   Automatically adjust range selection to non-zero content of the histogram.
   Can be actiavted also with Ctrl * keys combinations.
   Thanks to Mixael Traxler for nice idea.   

Changes in Go4 v4.5.3 (devel Summer 2012)/ v4.5.4 (Release November 2012)
1. Added macro fft.C for fast fourier transform of histograms into gui command line.
2. Adjustments for new root versions >5.99 (wrapper go4iostream.h)
3. Added some keyboard shortcuts for histogram display manipulation:
    Ctrl-Left/Ctrl-Right: Expand/Unexpand range on x axis 
	Left/Right:  Move Histogram left/right on x axis (only if range was expanded)
	Up/Down: Expand/Unexpand range on y axis (toggles autoscale off)	
	Shift-Up/Shift-Down: Move Histogram up/down on y axis (only if range was expanded)
	Ctrl-End/Ctrl-Home: Expand/Unexpand range on z axis (toggles autoscale off)	
	Shift-Home/Shift-End: Move Histogram up/down on z axis (only if range was expanded)
    Ctrl-Minus: Unzoom ranges totally
    Ctrl-Plus: Show/hide range settings window
    Ctrl-Page Up: Y axis in logarithmic scale
    Ctrl-Page Down: Y axis in linear scale    
    F5: Refresh display of all remote Histograms
    Shift-C: Clear all remote Histograms _remotely_
    Shift-M: Start monitoring timer 
    Shift-N: Stop  monitoring timer
    Note: All these shortcuts do work only if the corresponding toolboxes 
    (zoom tools, browser options, short histogram draw options) are active!
4. Added shortcut F1 to display the Go4 Introduction Manual as Help. 
5. Added shortcuts F6,F7,F8 to toggle visibility of 
    browser, logger, and mbs monitor dock windows (F9 for DABC monitor if compiled with DIM)    
6. GUI analysis status ratemeter: Tooltip of runtime seconds  this time
   as hour:minute:seconds representation. 
   Bugfix: "rotating go4 logo" in statusbar when analysis is running was not working in Qt3 
7. Graphical Markers and Conditions: Added possibility to define a "printf style" 
     format string in for the float number display in marker/condition label box 
     (default is %.4E). When selecting the marker/the condition display on TPad via mouse button, 
     the ROOT context menu provides method SetNumFormat(const char*) to change the 
     settings of current marker. Context menu function SaveLabelStyle() will set current 
     format as default for all markers/conditions. MainWindow menu "Settings/Panel Defaults/MarkerLabels..." 
     also has new field to set this format string. These defaults can be saved to go4 settings.      
8. Add full-screen mode for main window (F11). Both for qt3 and qt4   
9. New printout option for go4analysis: "go4analysis -print bhead fhead" 
    will print lmd buffer and/or file headers together with the event headers. 
    Additionally, most recent time string from buffer header is printed together with
    event header
10. Disable SIGPIPE signal for go4 sockets. Signal was generated when oposite
    communication side stopped or breaked irregulary without sockets closing.
    In this case signal was generated and was not treated properly by the framework.
11. Workaround for ROOT feature in go4analysis - at some point gSystem pointer
    can be set by 0 and can lead to analysis crash. Now this checked and go4
    stops immediately.     
12. Allow to specify port number for any MBS source (beside file) in form
    name:port like calling "go4analysis -stream node:6543". Same can be done in gui.
13. Add ExecuteScript() method to analysis and event processor. Simplifies
    usage of macros in user code. 

Changes in Go4 v4.5.2 (April 2012)
1. Bugfix in gui shutdown: circular deletion of mainwindow and timer could 
   lead to crash on suse 12.1. Also changed details of shutdown mechanism, 
   hope to fix the "hanging analysis with 99% cpu" problems (this may happen 
   when gui terminates before analysis was properly disconnected).
2. Adjusted Makefile.config for suse 12.1
3. Add in MakeParameter method possibility to execute setup macro
4. In GetParameter method one could optionally specify class name, 
   which will be verified
5. Adjust savecond.C and saveparam.C macros
6. Add possibility to change default position of stat box (only for qt4 gui)
7. Add support of composite events in dynamic list editor (qt3/qt4)
8. Add retry counter for some MBS sources - let reconnect server if
   it was down for some time. Useful for online analysis when server can
   be switched off/on very often for short time. Implemented in MBS source class,
   can be configured in go4analysis, qt3/at4 gui, hotstart.
9. Fix error in event selection of MBS sources like stream server, 
   make more compact event source selection in the gui (qt4 only)
10.Fix error in fitgui - in wizard mode model assignment to the 
   data component was not working (problem only in qt4 version)
11.Allow to use TArrayI and TArrayD in the TGo4Parameter and parameter editor.
   Now parameter elements of such classes can be edited and store in script
12.Allow to specify several files in row as argument of command "go4analysis -file ..."
   It is very useful in the case when wildcard characters are used. Shell 
   automatically expands all wildcards itself and therefore previous go4 versions
   get errors. Now following command is valid: "go4analysis -file *.lmd". 
   Make debug output of the analysis more clear when processing many files. 
13.Add -rate argument to the go4analysis executable. Enables output of current
   rate in batch mode.
14.Force loop-back address (127.0.0.1) as gui host name for connection 
   from analysis to gui when running analysis with exec mode or with ssh localhost mode. 
   Solves problem to run go4 without properly configured network. Changed only in
   etc/go4.prefs file, can be adjusted by user.   

Changes in Go4 v4.5.1 (November 2011)
1. Add force32=true flag to the Makefile, done to force 32 bit compilation and
   linking on 64-bit platform. Done to support such kind of MacOS machine,
   not tested (probably, not required) on Linux. 
2. Correctly treat "fetch when drawing" option in all cases. Before in some 
   situations (like double-click on multipad panel or drag-and-drop) object
   was fetched even if flag was disabled. Fixed in qt3/qt4 versions.
3. Adjust init scripts and README how to compile go4 in Windows.
4. Bugfix in composite event: When reading from TTree, setting the branch addresses 
   to the subcomponents failed in case that more subcomponents were in file than preallocated.
   Now we store the complete length of TObjArray with composite event and ensure that array 
   is not re-allocated during the tree read.
5. Bugfix/change in default TGo4EventElement::Fill() - valid flag was always
   set depending on BuildEvent() return value, did overrule user settings. Disabled this.   
6. Bugfix in gui - user source port number, specified in analysis configuration gui, 
   was not delivered to the user source constructor
7. New feature - possibility to specify optional port number for any MBS servers.
   Necessary for working with DABC where port number can be changed freely. Useful
   for virtual machines, where ports around 6000 are blocked.
8. Added support for x-axis time display in TGraph and TH1. New Items in Viewpanel Options menu:
   "X-Axis displays time" and "Set xaxis time format" 
9. Adjusted build system for gcc 4.6.1 (Ubuntu 10.11)
10. Bugfix in Qt4 GUI: on MacOs and gnome desktops, window menus were all put to screen system
    menu. This caused main window menu to disappear after opening first viewpanel.
11. Introduced event processor API methods SetKeepInputEvent() and SetKeepOutputEvent() to 
    provide "1 to n" and "n to 1" event building functionality. To be used if input event contains
    several output event data sets, or vice versa if several input events must be processed to
    gain one output event. Each time these methods are called in event processor, the next analysis cycle
    will skip all previous, or all subsequent analysis steps, resp, and will reprocess the input, or continue
    filling the output event data, resp.
12. Changed Go4LockGuard: do not use TThread::Exists() anymore. Because of ROOT internal mutex, 
    this call will not save any mutex lock, but introduce additional one.           


Changes in Go4 v4.5.0 (August 2011)
1. Fix problem with Ctrl-C handler. Now in batch in all cases
   analysis will be stopped correctly.
2. Significant changes in event classes. Reincarnation of TGo4CompositeEvent.
   It is now can be used again as output/input of any step. Many errors are fixed.
3. Add possibility to hide TGo4EventElement members from tree viewer and event
   viewer. This makes look of data structures, especially in composite events,
   much more clean. Default is off, can be changed via Settings->Preferences menu.
   Implemented for both qt3 and qt4 version.
4. Correctly display structure of composite event in the analysis browser.
5. Added composite event example in Go4ExampleAdvanced
6. Bugfix in help window display: Sometimes QProcess did not launch 
pdf viewer script correctly. Workaround: use detached QProcess
7. Bugfix/workaround in MBS monitor: sometimes it appeared that timer was skipped, resulting in
wrong data/event rates as calculated by Go4. Introduced check of real time against timer period
to correct rate and trend histogram if necessary.

Changes in Go4 v4.4.3 (March 2011)
1. Implement proper Ctrl-C handler for Windows platform
2. Fix several problems with settings savings. There is 
   known issue with dockable widgets (http://bugreports.qt.nokia.com/browse/QTBUG-16252),
   therefore qt4.7.0 and 4.7.1 has a problem to correctly restore browser/logger position. 
3. Adjust to Miscrosoft Visual Studio 2010.
4. Bugfix in dabc monitor: table of DAQ nodes were set up with sorting enabled.
   Added some flags to protect table rendering
5. Extension of TGo4LockGuard class to force locking even when no ROOT thread exists.
   Important when race condition code shall be protected against foreign pthreads (e.g. DIM)  
6. Adjusted to new version of gSTORE RFIO/ lmd event input
7. Implement -print argument for go4analysis program. This allows to print any kind
   of event on the terminal - even without actual user analysis. For instance:
      go4analysis -stream r4-4 -number 10 -print
   will print 10 events from MBS stream server r4-4. Print also works with user source.
8. Implement TGo4FileStore::SetMaxTreeSize method to let configure size of created tree.
   Add -maxtreesize argument to go4analysis to change value in batch.
9. Use gStyle->GetStatFormat() for formatting of fitter parameters output.
   Add possibility to configure this format from GUI via Settings/Panel defaults/Printf menu.
   Implemented in qt3/qt4 versions. 
10.Add possibility to display/monitor TLatex object from analysis (qt3/qt4).

Changes in Go4 v4.4.2 (October 2010)
1. Fix analysis crash when autosave file cannot be created in specified locations. 
2. Add handling of event timeout exception to analysis, running in batch mode.
   Prevents unexpectable break of analysis due to low data rate.
3. Improve Ctrl-C handling in analysis, which runs under gui control.
   Now after first Ctrl-C analysis will try normally finish event loop and exit.
   After second Ctrl-C it tries immediately store autosave file and exit.
   All consequent Ctrl-C will just terminate analysis.
4. Add in go4analysis event source exception handling, 
   display more info with MBS source errors.
5. Small fixes in fitpanel - info pad displays FWHM of the line, 
   list of models in wizard is navigated correctly
6. Solve problem that after loading of user library, classes from it was not 
   available automatically to the gui. Now one again can use custom histogram
   classes in the gui if appropriate library is loaded.
7. Support of new RFIO v6.0.
8. Check with gcc 4.5.0
9. Fix error with user source example under Windows.
10. Added possibility that output event of first analysis step can be declared as MbsEvent and
    just save the incoming mbs event into ROOT tree without copying the data: 
    added method TGo4MbsEvent::AssignReference() allows to use TGo4MbsEvent as a "reference" to another 
    TGo4MbsEvent; added constructor TGo4MbsEvent(const char*) to use it with standard factory
11. Bugfix in TGo4MbsEvent: memory leak in subevent array when reading back from TTree
12. Bug fix: when loading analysis preference file, check all appropriate keys in the file.
    Before analysis object name was fixed and name of status object also was fixed.
13. Feature fix. When autosave file had complex directory structure, 
    it took sometimes minutes just to open it during analysis start.
    Normally analysis reads histograms in the beginning (when autosave enabled) and
    file was opened in "update" mode. When closing such file, ROOT writes complete directory
    structure back to the file, which may takes minutes. Therefore, for reading
    autosave will be opened in "read", when writing "recreate" will be used. 
14. Use 64-bit integer for analysis loop count. 
    Display correctly number of processed events in gui.
15. Add possibility to select font in analysis window. Sometime it is useful to
    set fixed-size font there to see better formatted output from analysis.        
16. When closing GUI with running analysis, sometimes analysis was hanging with 100%
    CPU consumption. In most cases it happens when running analysis in qt terminal.
    Now GUI suggest to wait more time that analysis can shutdown normally or user can
    kill analysis and exit immediately.
17. Analysis configuration window: automatic clear of eventsource names when switching
    type of source. Bugfix: filename filter for listmode files did not work.
18. Bugfix: when disconnecting analysis task, 
	added Quit() method in analysis client which closes analysis first 
	to avoid hanging analysis thread (see 16.)           
     

Changes in Go4 v4.4.1 (May 2010)
1. Default implementation for TGo4Parameter methods are provided. 
   Now Clear(), PrintParameter() and UpdateFrom() methods has meaningful
   functionality and can be used as is in user derived classes.
   Thus, it is possible to declare user parameter class without any additional methods.
   See Go4ExampleSimple and Go4Example1Step. 
2. Add support of arbitrary objects in TGo4Picture::AddSpecialObject, 
   show real picture size in the browser   
3. Add possibility to specify wildcard in TGo4EventSource class - 
   allow to treat many subsequent root files, improve wildcard treatment in TGo4MbsFile,
   provide wildcard functionality for Windows
4. Fix (implement) "-source" argument for go4analysis
5. Fix problem with TASImage zooming, allow to switch palette on/off in asimage mode    
6. Improvements in fitpanel, that it can correctly display fitters, produced by examples
7. Keep and restore panel name in hotstart file. 
8. Support UserGUI in Win32, solve windows export/import problems
9. Allow to configure default draw options for classes like TH1/2/3, TGraph
10.Support of MacOS X (Darwin)
11.Add to TGo4Analysis static methods IsBatchMode(), IsClientMode(), IsServerMode(), 
   returning running mode of the analysis. Variable set in go4analysis program 
   and therefore methods can be used already in user analysis constructor.
12.Provide meaningful implementation for TGo4Analysis::SendObjectToGUI method. 
   Now user can send any registered object (histogram, graph, condition) to gui, 
   where it will be automatically updated. If object displayed, viewpanel will be updated.
   This allows do histogram monitoring without activating monitoring mode. 
13.Bugfix in shutdown of analysis server (did crash or deadlock sometimes due to fast disconnect of guis)       
14.Optional polygon condition in projection macros.

Changes in Go4 v4.4.0 (November 09)
1. Add clear histogram and conditions button in gui
2. System configuration tested once and stored in 
   $GO4SYS/build/Makefile.gener file. This simplifies compilation
   of user analysis and excludes misconfiguration.
3. Makefile logic improved to be able work with system-wide installed 
   ROOT version - ROOTSYS no longer required to be set. Instead root-config
   script should be always available via PATH variable. 
4. ROOT/Qt/Go4 library paths directly specified in all go4 executables 
   (go4, user analysis). This speeds up start time and allows to run 
   gui and analysis without any login scripts. To disable this compilation
   option, during compilation call "make rpath=false"       
5. Introduce standard go4analysis executable, which can be used to launch
   any user analysis, loading it from the user (typically libGo4UserAnalysis) library. 
   Minimum changes (if any) required to old user code.
   ExampleSimple, Example1Step, Example2Step adjusted to this scheme.  
6. Introduced go4-config utility, which provide possibility to use go4 without setting
   environment variables like GO4SYS or LD_LIBRARY_PATH. The only requirement is that
   go4-config should be accessible via PATH variable or should be placed in one of 
   the standard locations. Will be the main point to provide go4 install feature.
7. New install capability in makefile. One can compile complete go4 with 
   command "make prefix=/usr/local", where prefix variable defines installation directory.
   After compilation completed, "make install" command will copy binaries 
   in bin/, libraries in lib/, includes in /include/go4 and 
   other additional staff in share/go4/ subdirectories. After installation it is enough
   just provide PATH variable to bin/ subdirectory to be able fully use go4 GUI
   and compile user analysis. To use such installation in old makefiles, 
   GO4SYS variable should be defined and point to share/go4/ subdirectory. 
   Or one can slightly modify old makefile, specifying there 
   GO4SYS=$(shell go4-config --go4sys) - see standard examples.  
8. go4 gui can be started with "-observer", "-controller", "-admin" arguments, 
   followed by optional hostname [localhost], port number [5000] and 
   access password [none] which defines running analysis server. 
   This simplify gui handling when running analysis from other shell.
   Especially useful when running analysis with go4analysis executable like:
   "go4analysis -server -stream mbshost" 
9. From gui one can launch analysis without remote shell (ssh or rsh), but just 
   with simple exec command. This solves problem, when ssh requires running 
   DNS even when launching analysis on the same node. 
   This also allows to launch analysis from windows gui.  
10.Logic how analysis started from the gui is completely changed. 
   Instead of two intermediate shell scripts analysis executable called directly. 
   All shell/terminal/initialization settings for such command collected
   in etc/go4.prefs file. User allowed to create its own go4.prefs file in current
   directory to redefine some settings. With conditional syntax one can define
   host/os specific configuration how is analysis started. This approach allows
   run go4 analysis on the nodes with completely different OS/software settings.
   Old scheme (via AnalysisStart.sh scripts) can be activated by setting 
   export GO4OLDLAUNCH=yes variable before gui start.       
11.Allow to run analysis, compiled into library, from the gui. 
   From this point on it is no longer necessary to have 
   MainUserAnalysis executable at all - it is removed from all examples. 
12.Signal handler is used to normally stop analysis by Ctrl-C
   pressing from the user - stop processing, close connections, 
   save autosave file.
13.Support TGraphPolar in draw options selection.
14.Make default location for gui settings account wide, one should define 
   export GO4SETTINGS=LOCAL to store/use gui settings in current directory.
15.Simplify event source handling in user code. It is no longer required that
   event class 'knows' all its possible sources - only source itself decides 
   which event class and how it fills. Cleanup all sources class in go4 and 
   examples. Old code will work as is.
16.go4analysis executable search user library for new classes and create user
   analysis instance, using predefined signatures: (const char*) or (int, char**). 
   Constructor  signature (int, char**) like for main() function allows to
   deliver arbitrary arguments to user code (see Example2Step).
   If standard signature not found, any non-default constructor will be tried - 
   most old examples and codes should work. Alternatively, one can define
   CreateUserAnalisys(const char*) function to create analysis instance.  
17.Improve saveparam.C and savecond.C macros - better readable code. 
   SavePrimitive() methods are used, implemented for parameter and condition classes. 
   New saveall.C macro to store all conditions and parameters in single macro file.

Changes in Go4 v4.3.1 (August 09)
1. Fix error with connecting DABC/MBS servers second time
2. Fix error (introduced in v4.3.0) with using autosave files - 
   object was not found correctly there
3. Set green/red color in analysis status monitor widget
4. In qt3 version exclude all 3 gui libraries, integrating code 
   in executable (similar to qt4)
5. Suppress symbolic links in user gui library to avoid compilation problem
   on DOS partitions, where links are not supported
6. Set in gStyle pad frame color white
7. Workaround for TCutG API changes in ROOT 5.25.1 and further         

Changes in Go4 v4.3.0 (June 09)
1. Remove Q3Support classes completely - now Qt4 based GUI is 
   pure Qt4 application. This solves many side effects like crash
   by style changing or blinking during resize of main window.
   From this version on Qt4 GUI is default. 
2. rootmap files are generated per library - this simplifies make 
   procedure significantly, old user makefiles are still working
3. Go4 makefile now can better recognize standard installed Qt version
   without QTDIR set. 'make WITHQT=3' or 'make WITHQT=4' forces usage of 
   specified Qt version.
4. Fix problem with drawing of THStack from canvas or file. 
5. Add proxy for THStack to be able browse into THStack and 
   draw single histograms from it 
6. Better autoscale of THStack class
7. Ensure that drawing of histogram first time done only once,
   in case of 2D histograms doubles the performance
8. When running GUI, one can specify one or several root files,
   which will be loaded automatically
9. BUGFIX: GUI was hanging when non-existing hotstart file was specified.
10.New MakeTH1, MakeTH2, MakeWinCond, MakePolyCond, MakeParameter methods
   in TGo4EventProcessor class are implemented. They provide easy way 
   to produce analysis objects or take them from the autosave file. 
   See analysis examples how these methods can be used.
11.Examples only have Makefile, no Module.mk any more.
12.Make "COL" as default option for 2-D histogram, improves significantly 
   speed for large histograms, one can always goes back to scatter plot 
13.Analysis, running inside GUI, runs without DISPLAY variable set (ssh -x).
   If any graphics required in analysis, one should run it in separate
   xterm/konsole application, where ssh -X is done.
14.After Go4 built, one can call "make clean-bin" to remove all object and
   dependency files, but executables and libraries will remain. Useful 
   for installation. Now one can compile (but not run) Go4 without Go4SYS set. 
15.Histogram title position is now preserved and restored when histogram is updated.
16.Solve problem with flickering widgets in Qt4 GUI.
17.Make Go4ExampleSimple really simple - no more complex parameters or initialization.
   Main executable is now more flexible when specifying command line arguments.    
18.When new view panel is created, it should always fit into current main
   window - before one can get view panel which two time larger. 
19.Go4 event loop optimization - simple analysis with GUI runs 10-20% faster than before.
20.Configuration of Qt4 GUI is stored by default in current directory in Go4.conf file.
   One can do "export GO4SETTINGS=ACCOUNT" to store GUI settings in account-wide location. 
21.Replace "disable" by "enable" check boxes in analysis configuration -  
   makes configuration more intuitive. Shortcut of each step configuration can
   be seen together with step name on the top of analysis configuration panel.   
22.Provide better log output when Go4 open/change/closes lmd/root files in analysis.
   End of ROOT file no longer results in ERROR exception, but in End of File exception.
23.Automatic stop after specified number of events
   For all MBS event sources an event count can be set in configuration panel after
   which the analysis is stopped and can be continued for the next number of events.
   The current values for files specify start and end event number as found in the 
   event data. Often this event number starts not from 0 and is even rather unknown.
   In addition it does not allow for stepping through a file.
   Note that an event function can stop the loop by throwing TGo4EventEndException(this)
   (TGo4EventEndException.h must be included).
24.For multiple plots he canvas division is taken from the values given in the canvas widget.
   If these values do not fit, take defaults as now.
25.Tree browser: Several enhancements make usage much better:
   1. After dragging an item into the tree viewer field, focus is set into that field,
      because most probably one has to modify the index.
   2. A RET in that field triggers the browser.
   3. Dragging a field and RET accumulates over all indices.
   4. TABs move to next input field
   5. Histograms can be cleared in workspace.
26.BUGFIX: Adding histograms to an superimpose enabled canvas changed color only once to red,
   all following black. Selecting histograms and superimpose in new plot showed different 
   colors as expected. Fixed. 

Changes in Go4 v4.02.00 (April 09)

1. Merge Go4 version 3 with Go4 version 4 together - now
   same package can be compiled either with Qt 3.3 or Qt 4.4.x.
   Version of Qt can be selected by setting proper QTDIR path.
   If QTDIR is not set, default version will be used (if any) 
2. Replace html documents by pdf, use external pdf viewer for them.
3. Reduce usage of qt3support classes in Qt4 part of GUI.
4. Add in Go4Example2Step example of TGo4Fitter usage   
5. Few more options can be set in TGo4Picture:
   SetStatsAttr(xLeft,yBottom,xRight,yTop,101); (bottom < top)
   SetAxisTitleFontSize(axis, size, 0); axis=0,1,2
   SetAxisLabelFontSize(axis, size, 0); size 0.01...0.1
   SetTitleAttr(xLeft,yBottom,xRight,yTop);
   

Changes in Go4 v4.01.01 (November08)

1. Maintenance: code adjustments for compilers gcc 4.3.x

2. Bugfix for Qt problem: QProcess was put into infinite loop 
after first stderr output to Go4 analysis window. 
Workaround: redirect stderr to stdout in analysis startup script.

3. Bugfix: counter overflow in TGo4MbsSource would stop taking 
events from mbs connections and let process last read event 
multiple times

4. Several small bugfixes.

Changes in Go4 v4.01.00 (October08)

1. New toolwindow DABC Monitor: Allows to inspect all info services
registered to any DIM server. Any DABC ratemeter service running on 
DABC or MBS nodes may be monitored and filled into trending and 
statistic histograms. This tool is build optionally if environment 
$DIMDIR is set and DIM is installed there.

2. Bugfix: MbsAPI streamserver connection timeout was not working 
correctly (leads to hangup of analysis control when no data is 
delivered from streamserver).

3. Bugfix: Viewpanel canvas was not working with Qt >= 4.4.x (empty
widget with grey background) because Qt workspace may change 
X-window id at runtime.  Improved Go4QtRoot interface
classes to reset winId dynamically on resize. Modified rendering of
TQRootCanvas to avoid unnecessary Qt double buffering.

4. Bugfix: Viewpanel embedded TGedEditor was sometimes not displayed
at startup. Improved Go4QtRoot interface to avoid extra Resize()
in TQRootWindow::paintEvent which may lose coordinates of 
primary editor tab.

5. Bugfix: "Settings/Style" menu would crash GUI sometimes due to
unresolved problems in QtApplication::setStyle when called 
at application runtime. Workaround: menu will select style for 
Go4 settings, style is no sooner activated than on next startup.

6.  Bugfix: "Settings/Fonts..." menu would crash GUI sometimes due to
unresolved problems in QtApplication::setFont when called 
at application runtime. Workaround: menu will select font for 
Go4 settings, font is no sooner activated than on next startup.

7. Bugfix: QGo4Settings is not working correctly anymore with Qt>4.4 
due to modifications in QSettings API and Qt settings location. 
Now general settings must always be kept 
at $HOME/.config/GSI/.Go4.conf 
and can not vary for different directories in the same account. 
However, the main window toolbar setup may still be saved locally 
(at $PWD/.config/GSI/Go4toolsrc, default), or account specific
(at $HOME/.config/GSI/Go4toolsrc). This is selected as before
by setting environment variable Go4SETTINGS="ACCOUNT".




Changes in Go4 v4.00.03 (June08)

1. Viewpanel menu: "File/Produce Graph From Markers" will generate 
new TGraph in local workspace containing the points of all 
Go4markers set in the current pad. May be used to fit function to 
manually selected positions.
2. Bugfix: Fitpanel range display in expert mode.


Changes in Go4 v4.00.02 (May08)
1. Support of Solaris with CC 5.x (without RFIO)
2. Modifications in makefiles - now only in one place in Makefile.config
   one should specify platform - Linux, Solaris or Win32.
   Other small changes in makefiles   
3. Fixes different warnings from Solaris CC compiler
4. Bugfix: GUI TreeViewer swapped x/y/z coordinates, convention is TTree::Draw("z:y:x"))
5. Bugfix: GUI Viewpanel: "Produce Picture" did not save all draw options to picture 


Changes in Go4 v4.00.01 (Mar08)

1. Bugfix: Adjustments for modifications in ROOT signal-slot mechanism
   syntax (ROOT >=5.19/02); this caused viewpanel crash.

2. Bugfix: Mismatch between Go4 viewpanel range (full visible range)
   and ROOT user range (referring to low edges of bins) could cause slight
   shift of x axis range on canvas refresh.


Changes in Go4 v4.00.00 (Feb08)

1. Ported the Go4 GUI for Qt Version 4. This includes the main Go4GUI, the
Go4UserGUI example, and the GSI qtroot interface with the Go4 extensions.
  
Notes: 
------
   a) Go4 v4 REQUIRES Qt3support libraries of Qt4 installation (should be configure default).
   
   b) Go4 v4 needs to disable the XInitThreads() in ROOT TGClient initialization 
      to avoid conflicts between ROOT X11 graphics and Qt4. 
      This is only possible for new ROOT versions that support 
      to switch the X11.XInitThread resource by environment settings (thanks to Fons Rademakers!).
      
      => Go4 v4 REQUIRES ROOT VERSION > 5.19/01  
      
   c) Go4 v4 will not work anymore with Qt Versions 3.x. To use Go4 with Qt3,
      please install Go4 versions 3.03.0x which will still be supported in parallel.  

2. Improvements in Mbs event library: Added new event types for future GSI data acquisition
framework DABC. Some minor bugfixes.

3. Bugfix in TGo4Browser. Arrays fVisibleColumns and fIndexes has 1 item less than required.

4. Bugfix in QRootApplication. In constructor numc argument must be 
   delivered as reference.

5. Minor bugfix in TGo4MBSViewer - status record must be cleared in constructor.




Changes in Go4 v3.03.01 (Nov07)

1. Correct work of marker class in case of superimposed histograms.
   Now newly created marker will be assigned to currently 
   selected histogram.
2. Bugfix in fit package concerning parameters handling when some
   parameters are fixed.
3. In FitGui in Wizard and Expert mode there is now possibility to 
   clone existing model component. Especially usefull in case of 
   TGo4FitModelFunction and TGo4FitModelFormula classes, which are
   require a number of different settings.
4. Bugfix in MbsAPI, f_stccomm.c file. Fixes problem with connecting 
   64 bit machine to MBS events/stream/trasnport server. False 
   usage of select() function.
5. Small adjustments for the new ROOT (5.17.05) browser.
6. Two ROOT libraries (libTree and libGpad) added to Go4 rootmap file 
   that user Go4 analysis library can be loaded in CINT session.
7. ThreadManager workaround for ROOT bug in TThread::Delete() (ROOT bug report 31085): 
   for some compilers, Go4  GUI crashed when shutting down or 
   disconnecting analysis.


Changes in Go4 v3.03.00 (May07)

1. Added missing includes for <math.h>, required by some compilers.

2. Viewpanel and marker editor: A point- or region marker and its label will
pop to the pad foreground when it is selected with left mouse button. Additionally,
selection of a marker in the combo box of the editor will let it appear frontmost.

3. Viewpanel: In superimpose mode selected histogram can be moved
on the top of complete histogram stack via new menu command
"Select/show histo on top".

4. GUI commandline: added macro template "Scale X" (scalex.C) to
scale x axis of 1D histogram with linear calibration function.

5. Some Makefile and build script improvements

6. Bugfix for changes in ROOT>v5.14 pad cleanup:
Viewpanel with Go4 markers on subpads crashed when closed or cleared.

7. Bugfixes concerning 64 bit compatibility
    (pointer arithmetics, avoid gcc builtin malloc())

8. Adjustments to suppress gcc 4.1 warnings about casting
pointers to dereferenced structure members


Changes in Go4 v3.02.7 (Feb07)

1. Fitpanel improvement: keep y-scaling when fitting on x
subrange of histogram

2. Autoscale checkbox as shortcut on top of each viewpanel



Changes in Go4 v3.02.6 (Feb07)

1. Due to changes in ROOT in many Go4 files includes like
   "TROOT.h", "TMath.h", "TList.h" are missing.
   Sometimes user should also include these files in user code.

2. In latest ROOT TBuffer class becomes abstract, therefore one cannot
   use it directly in the code. Instead, TBufferFile class should be used.
   To support different ROOT version, TGo4Buffer definition was introduced.
   For old ROOT versions, it is directly TBuffer, for newer - from TBufferFile.
   TGo4Buffer.h file should be included only at the place, where new object is
   created, for all other places TBuffer class should be used.

3. Zoom toolbar: added buttons for scaling z-axis of 2d histograms.

4. New icons for zoom toolbar and draw options toolbar.

5. New additional draw options toolbar to select commonly used
   drawing options by buttons (lin/log, line, histo, some 2d styles).
   The new toolbar is displayed via the RMB options pull down menu.

6. 1-d histogram drawing. Due to some features of ROOT histogram painter
   several draw options (lin, barchart and others) not working after
   TH1::SetSumw2() is called - in there Sumw2 array sum of squares of weights
   is accumulated. Modification in Go4 code were done to
   avoid Sumw2 arrays when it not necessary.

7. Improvment in speed of view panel redraw (up to factor of 2).

Changes in Go4 v3.02.5 (Dec06)

1. Bugfix in Go4Socket library (missing include)
because of changes in ROOT version 5.14-00

2. Improvement in TGo4MbsFile for partial read of lmd file:
Corrected mismatch between first event index and real event number
(before: index=event number-1).

3. New example macro scalex.C to scale x-axis of histogram with
linear calibration function

Changes in Go4 v3.02.4 (Oct06)

1. Adjustment of Makefile because of changes in default
libraries for ROOT >= 5.13/04(separated libSpectrum.so)

2. Viewpanel draw options enhanced: support for TGraph draw modes and
TGraphErrors error style. Reorganization of draw options for TH1/TH2.
New draw options tool for line, marker, and fill colors of
histograms and graphs.

3. Viewpanel menu "Select" to chose active object from superimposed
histograms and graphs.

4. Settings menu: "Show event status" selectable as default
pad option.

5. Settings menu: "Statistics Box..." dialog to define default pad options
for histogram statistics.

6. TGo4Picture: new method AddSpecialObject() to add any ROOT graphical
object (text labels, markers) to the picture

7. TGo4MbsFile: now can also read listmode data of old event
formats type 4,1 and 4,2.
Event will be converted implicitely into format 10,1 for further processing:
User unpack processor gets TGo4MbsEvent with one TGo4MbsSubevent that contains
all event data.



Changes in Go4 v3.02.3 (Sep06)

1. Bugfix: Problems with viewpanel scaling functionality when build
with gcc4.0.x compiler (FC5); fixed.

2. GUI command interface TGo4AbstractInterface. Added methods:
 - GetViewPanelName() - returns viewpanel name
 - SetViewPanelName() - changes viewpanel name

Changes in Go4 v3.02.2 (Sep06)

1. GUI command interface TGo4AbstractInterface. Added methods:
 - RedrawPanel() - updates viewpanel view
 - RedrawItem() - updates all views of specified items
 - FindViewPanel() - searchs for viewpanel of specified name
 - GetActiveViewPanel() - returns currently active viewpanel

2. Adjusted Go4ThreadManager package due to changes in
TTimer copy constructor for ROOT versions > 5.12.00

3. Some bugfixes concerning compilation against old
ROOT versions 4.08



Changes in Go4 v3.02.0 (July06)

1. Analsis framework:
TGo4EventElement now implements default method Fill() that
calls virtual function TGo4EventSource::BuildEvent(). As a consequence,
for a simple analysis the user only has to implement
TXXXUnpackProc::BuildEvent(); there is no need to develop a
user output event class. Even if output event structure shall be
used, methods Fill() and Init() are not necessarily needed for
a standard analysis. Go4ExampleSimple and Go4Example1Step
were changed accordingly.

2. Macro usage:
Analysis sets define __Go4ANAMACRO__ on startup, to be used
in any Go4 analysis script to check the current environment.
In GUI, the define __Go4MACRO__ can be checked analogously.

3. Parameter editor offers popup menu
"GetFromFitPanel"  for embedded fitters to update fitter settings
from the current fit editor. Useful for calibration parameters
that should be fitted interactively to spectra
(see Go4Example2Step).

4. Bugfix: Access to RFIO root files from Go4 GUI browser was
not possible (at gsi), since internal functions of libRFIO.so were
shadowed by functions of gsi event lib with same names. Solved by
separating Go4 event library package into different modules for
analysis and GUI task.

5. Bugfix: Analysis server executed UserPostLoop() every time
a GUI client was disconnected. Disabled.

6. Rebin in GUI. Now when histogram will be rebined via right-mouse
menu or via ROOT graphical editor, rebining will be kept when histogram
will be updated next time from analysis. Many viewews of the same histogram
with different binning is possible. Binning also kept in hotstart file.
TGo4Picture has new SetRebinX(), SetRebinY() methods to configure
rebinning of displayed histogram.

7. Condition Editor: New tab "Cut" for direct editing
of polygon condition coordinates


Changes in Go4 v3.01.2 (June06)

1. Some adjustments of project files to build under SuSe Linux 10.1

2. Start client dialog selects correct analysis directory when chosing the
analysis executable

3. All Go4 macros put into new subfolder $Go4SYS/macros. This
directory should be added to entry Unix.*.Root.MacroPath
in .rootrc setup file

4. Bugfix: Several changes concerning the cleanup mechanism
in GUI object manager

5. Bugfix: AnalysisClient in CINT mode showed thread deadlock for ROOT
versions> 5.02-00




Changes in Go4 v3.01.0 (May06)

1. New script command line widget for GUI:
Allows execution of ROOT commands or macros within Go4 GUI task.
Moreover, Go4 hotstart scripts may be invoked here at any time.
The widget offers a file dialog to search for *.C and *.hotstart files.
It also has a selector dialog of preloaded commodity functions
for histogram manipulation (rebin, addition, projection, etc.). These function
template calls may be completed with exisiting histogram names
by dragging histogram items from the browser and dropping them on
the empty command argument.
The history of the command line may be saved to the current Go4
settings file .Go4/Go4localrc and is then restored on next startup.

2. New GUI command interface class TGo4AbstractInterface.
It can be accessed by handle "Go4->" in GUI command line. This makes
it possible to interact with Go4 GUI views and browser objects in a
ROOT/Go4 script. Additionally, all remote analysis control commands
are available here, like in the hotstart scripts.
Method reference of TGo4AbstractInterface is available in the Go4
help viewer (type "help" in GUI command line, or use
"Help/GUI commandline" menu of Go4 main window).
Example scripts using this interface are at $Go4SYS/macros
(definitions of the preloaded command line histogram functions)

3. New general marker label settings dialog. In main window menu
"Settings/Panel Defaults/Markel labels...", a checkbox dialog offers
to switch all label properties of the region and point markers
(visibility and information displayed in the label). These settings
have effect on all new markers of the viewpanel marker editor. They are
saved in the Go4 preferences file .Go4/Go4localrc.

4. New settings feature "Settings/Preferences/Fetch when saving".
If enabled, the "save browser / save memory" button of the file
toolbar will refresh all browser item objects from analysis before
saving. Thus the ROOT file will contain a snapshot of all analysis
objects. Otherwise, only the already fetched objects are saved.

5. Zoom tools "set scale" dialog upgraded to non modal MDI widget.
This will appear always on top of workspace widgets and refers to currently
selected viewpanel pad. Changes include some bugfixes concerning the
range settings of 2d histograms, and the autoscale property.

6. FitPanel settings are saved/restored in Go4 settings file

7. Viewpanel superimpose mode improvements:
   - is not changed anymore after superimposed draw of FitPanel results,
   i.e. fitter data histogram can now be replaced just by  drag and drop on the viewpanel
   - existing axis labels of first histogram are kept
   - Bugfix: histogram title could not be switched off in superimpose mode

8. Bugfix: crash when FitPanel histogram under work was replaced or deleted in viewpanel.

9. Bugfix: Workaround for ROOT crash in histogram rebin editor:
Selecting a histogram in viewpanel for rebin with the ROOT attributes
editor lead to segmentation violation when original histogram
was replaced or deleted.

10. Bugfix: crash in Go4 markers/conditions when histogram in viewpanel was
replaced by drag and drop.



Changes in Go4 v3.00.2 (Mar06)

1. Adjustments of includes due to changes in new ROOT version 5.10

2. Bugfix: Update of histogram in GUI failed when histogram dimensions
(ranges) were changed in analysis


Changes in Go4 v3.00.1 (Jan06)

1. Mbs monitor tool: If monitoring on, calculation of rates now
done in Go4, averaged over update time. Parameters of mbs monitor
are stored in Go4 settings file.

2. Position and size of histogram statistic label may now be saved
in Go4 picture objects. Thus these properties
can be restored on Go4 hotstart.

3. TGo4Interface: new method ExecuteLine to remotely do CINT call
from Go4 master process in the remote slave process

4. Bugfix in viewpanel: crash on closing last non-minimized window

5. Bugfix in fitter: problem with empty TGraph as data source

6. Fit GUI: Enhanced draw styles for TGraph

7. Improvements in make files





Changes in Go4 v3.00.0 (Nov05)

1. Redesign of the GUI with new internal object manager. Decoupling of
controlling functionality from the  Qt graphics layer. Effects many
of the following features.

2. New Go4 browser. Instead of several tabs for remote analysis,
local memory, monitoring list, now one browser with subbranches for
different data sources, such as remote analysis, histogram servers,
root files,  is used. Supports local memory workspace folder with
copy and paste by drag and drop, clipboard, and renaming.
All controls available via rightmouse button context menu.
Switchable columns for object properties. Filter for monitored,
fetched, and all objects.

3. New viewpanel.  Improved marker editor with lightweight condition
editor. Additional options to display date and time of refresh, and
full object path. Can display same object with different draw styles
and ranges simultaneuously.  May store current setup as Go4 picture.


4. New condition editor: More compact layout, shares functionality
with viewpanel marker editor.

5. Improved parameter editor: May display user parameter structure
without loading the user analysis library into the GUI. Suppresses
display of unknown components.

6. New dynamic list editor: More compact layout. Automatic resolving
of event name and data member name when dragging and dropping from
analysis event structure, in case of pointer entry.
Dito for tree name and draw expression in case of tree entry.

7. New dockwindow for analysis terminal. If analysis is started
in external shell, functionality of analysis output window
(macro execution, etc.) shrinks to dockwindow.

8. Improved dialogs for analysis startup and connection.

9. Decoupling of libraries from GUI. GUI does not require all
analysis libraries anymore due to changes in command pattern and
dependency rearrangements. Will speed up GUI startup time and
may reduce memory consumption.

10. Status monitor for remote MBS node. New dockwindow offering
connection to the mbs status port. Frequently update of daq rates
and status possible. Trending histograms in browser workspace.
Full printout of mbs status and setup structures possible.

11. Go4 analysis status bar improved. Animated Go4 logo shows true
running state of analysis, independent of current event rate.
Current event source of first active step displayed per name in
text field.

12. Remote control of Go4 analysis from regular ROOT session.
Command interface to connect and control analysis process from CINT.
Inspecting and retrieving Go4 objects with extended root TBrowser
possible.

13. Optional release package for MsWindowsXP (without Qt graphics).
Required minor modifications in Go4 threadmanager for correct
canceling of win threads.



Changes in Go4 v2.10.0 (Jun05)

1. Go4TaskHandler redesign: Decouple client and server tasks from
master and slave role. This implies that analysis can run in the
network both asserver or client task (as in previous Go4 versions).
Vice versa, GUI can run either as client or as server  (previous
behavior). Additionally, TGo4AnalysisClient class now inherits
TGo4Slave (previously TGo4ClientTask), and TGo4Display inherits
TGo4Master (previously TGo4ServerTask).  One analysis server can be
connected by many Go4 GUIs (one controller/administrator GUI,
and several observer GUIs).

2. Go4TaskHandler redesign: Password for login of master client to
slave server with accounts for administrator, controller, and
observer roles. Additionally, some Go4 commands are forbidden
if master is logged in with a low priority account (observer e.g.
may not reconfigure analysis, but only request objects for display).
Default passwords may be changed in MainUserAnalysis code.

3. Go4GUI prepared to run with analysis server:  Command Go4 -client
will start the GUI master task in client mode. In this case,
the Launch analysis dialogue requests for login account, password,
node and connection port of the analysis server. Moreover, a client
GUI may first launch a new analysis server in an xterm and connect
to it afterwards.

4. Example of analysis server in package Go4Example2Step:
MainUserAnalysis may be started from command line with option
-server as third argument (first arguments like batch),
thus starting the analysis as server. Processing starts immediately
(no submit from GUI necessary). Command line parameters of this
example will set additional boolean arguments (servermode, autorun)
of  TGo4AnalysisClient constructor appropriately.

5. ROOT macro execution with Go4 analysis server: A Go4 environment
and analysis server can be started from any ROOT session in the
background (.x Go4Init.C). Go4 GUIs may connect to this server and
request data from running analysis macros, or control macro via
Start/Stop buttons. New methods TGo4Analysis::WaitForStart() to
poll for the Go4 environment running state, and
TGo4Analysis::Process() to invoke the Go4 analysis loop explicitely
from ROOT macro (checks also for STOP). Example macros hsimple.C,
hsimpleGo4.C and treedrawGo4.C

6. Analysis: UserPreLoop() and UserPostLoop() are only executed
once when analysis running state is changing. In previous versions,
each press on Start, or Stop button, respectively, would execute
the corresponding method another time. Bugfix: postloop was called
twice if analysis client was terminated in running state.

7. Bugfix: MbsAPI/f_evt.c (close of streamserver).

8. Bugfix: Labels for conditions and markers were not drawn
correctly in logscale anymore for ROOT v>4.03/02.

9. Bugfix: Monitoring list reset after disconnect. Monitoring
entries were sometimes deactivated after reconnecting analysis.

10. Fixed several small memory leaks.



New features in Go4 v2.9.1 (Apr05)

1 . Bugfix: Adjusted reallocation behaviour in TGo4Socket and
TGo4Buffer to changed definition of TBuffer::kIsOwner flag for
ROOT versions>4.03/02

2. Fixed several small memory leaks.



New features in Go4 v2.9 (Feb05)

1. Keyboard shortcuts for many functions.

2. Settings for Go4 GUI are now saved in the current directory by
default in $PWD/.Go4/Go4localrc and $PWD/.Go4/Go4toolsrc,
respectively. So different settings for the same login account
are possible now. If the current directory does not contain a Go4
settings file on Go4 GUI startup, it will be created using the
global account preferences at $HOME/.qt. Settings behavior can
be changed using environment variable Go4SETTINGS. If this is
set, the GUI  preferences are used from directory
$Go4SETTINGS. If Go4SETTINGS contains keyword ACCOUNT, the Go4
settings at $HOME/.qt are used (like in previous Go4 versions).

3. New context sensitive menus (right mouse button popup) for
all GUI browsers.

4. Root object editor TGedEditor will show up in view panel side
frame instead of top-level X-window. To implement this, the Go4
QtRoot interface has a new widget TQRootWindow which embeds a
root TGCompositeFrame into a QWidget.

5. Superimposed drawn histograms, THStack objects and TMultiGraph
will show a TLegend box in view panel. The legend box can be
switched on or off by view panel menu.

6. View panel marker editor: Added polygon shaped regions (TCutG).

7. File browser: Added "Open remote file" functionality to read
objects from TNetFile/XRootd (root:), TWebFile (http:),
and tape library (rfio:).

8. Analysis browser: Objects may be protected against Clear()
(histogram reset to 0), and against deletion in the analysis.
Browser shows protection state in 3rd column as "C" and "D"
symbols, respectively. Objects created from analysis code are
always protected against deletion, objects created from GUI may
be deleted from GUI again. Protection against clear may be
changed using the browser's right mouse button menu.
The protection state is persistent in the auto save file.

9. Analysis: Histograms associated with Go4 picture objects will
not appear anymore in the analysis Pictures folder, but only in
the Histograms folder.

10. Analysis macro: New analysis macro MainUserAnalysisMacro.C
in directory Go4ExampleSimple. It needs a .rootmap file for
automatically loading all necessary libraries.This file is
created by the new files Makefile and Module.mk from the example.
One can copy both files from the example, or modify existing
files if they contain application specific changes. Look for map-
expressions!

11. New Method TGo4Analysis::Print() to print the current setup
of the analysis and the steps.

12. Multiple input file (metafile) for TGo4MbsFile may contain
lines with CINT commands preceded by an "@" character. Commands,
e.g. root macro execution like ".x setup.C", are performed in
between change of event source.

13. Metafiles should have suffix .lml. Then they are recognized
without@. The main programs in the examples have been modified
not to add a .lmd to a .lml file name (update your main program
accordingly!).

14. TGo4FileSource: Partial IO functionality - name of the input
event defines name of the tree branch to be read. Additionally,
improved read performance for full event.

15. New Example Go4ExampleMesh to show how to setup an analysis
with non-subsequent analysis steps. May use partial input from
tree branch.

16. Reorganisation of Go4 make files and installation.
Reduced number of Go4 libraries. Removed unnecessary root
dictionary information from libraries. Go4 may be installed
without libASImage.so if this is not supported on the system.

17. Implemented .rootmap mechanism to auto-load required Go4
libraries in macros.

18. Bugfix: Preview panel options menu apply to all did not work
for histogram statistics property.

19. Bugfix: Double click in Go4 GUI browsers was not always
working, because of conflict with drag and drop mode.

20. Bugfix: When Submit was called without stopping the analysis
before, references set in UserPreLoop() were not
updated. Now UserPreLoop() is called also in this case. Additionally,
UserPostLoop() is not called when analysis stops after initialization has failed.

21. Bug fixes: A set of use cases has been set up to test the GUI
functionality. Several bugs have been found and fixed
performing these use cases. The test procedure has improved the
stability of the GUI. It will be extended and used for all
future Go4 updates.


New features in Go4 v2.8 (Sep04)

1.  Marker editor in view panel allows for marking
    channels or windows.  Labels and arrows can be created. All
    marker elements can be saved/restored.

2.  New ROOT graphical editor can be called from view panel.
    The editor dynamically adjusts to the graphical object
    selected by LMB.

3.  Viewpanel window title: can optionally be set by user and
    may be kept constant. If a TGo4Picture is displayed, the
    picture name defines the viewpanel title.

4.  Condition editor: the cursor mode has been removed because the
    functionality is now provided by the markers

5.  Condition, markers and labels: Implemented correct root
    streamer (bugfix), i.e. saving and loading these objects
    in root files is possible with fully recovered functionality
    and graphical properties. Support of pad display in
    lin/log scale (bugfix). Additional controls in RMB menu
    root (set ranges, location, save default properties,
    reset). Default label setup stored with Go4 GUI settings.

6.  Polygon condition: Implemented statistics functions for
    work histogram under the cut (integral, mean, rms, etc.).
    Enabled "InsertPoint/RemovePoint" function in RMB menu (bugfix).

7.  Fit GUI: Selection between sigma and FWHM (default) by
    Settings->Recalculate gauss width. Fit results may be
    printed to terminal or Go4 logfile output.

8.  1D drawing: ROOT "L" (line) "C" (curve) "B" (bar chart)
    "P0" (poly-marker) line styles supported.

9.  Histograms: re-binning, projections, and profiles
    supported (standard ROOT methods with RMB). Automatic
    "synchronize with memory" on pad click to get newly
    created histograms.

10. Histogram client: monitoring implemented (auto-update).
    Drag and drop support. Display error message when server
    connection is not available (bugfix). Store server
    specification in Go4 settings.

11. File store: Storing objects into a ROOT file a title is
    prompted. This title can be seen in the Go4 browser and
    the ROOT browser.

12. UserObjects folder: With AddObject(...) histograms,
    parameters and conditions can be put into folders of the
    UserObjects folder. They can be located there by the
    standard Get methods, e.g. GetHistogram. Editors work also
    with objects in these folders. Note: object names must
    be unique!

13. Log window: Empty messages are now suppressed (bug fix).

14. QtROOT interface: bug fix concerning initialization
    order of X11 system (ROOT init now before Qt init).
    Lead to crash of the main GUI on newer linux systems
    when using Qt versions > 3.1 (FEDORA2, SuSe9.1)

15. Thread manager: bug fix: adjusted default exception
    handling to work with newer libpthread.so that uses
    one process for all threads (e.g. FEDORA2). This lead
    to a crash when Go4 threads were canceled
    (shutdown of the Go4 GUI).

16. Analysis Framework: bug fix: analysis without analysis
    step (UserEventFunc only) again possible.

17. Client startup script: full PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    of the Go4 GUI environment is passed to the
    analysis process.


New features in Go4 v2.7

1. Keyboard shortcuts ("Alt-1" to "Alt-5") to select browser tabs
   (disk, monitor, remote, memory, histogram client).
   Items are selectable with arrow keys (left-right to unfold and
   shrink subfolders). Return key acts as doubleclick.

2. MbsEvent classes improvements: Method to check TGo4MbsSuvevent if
   it was filled in the previous mbsevent build. MbsEvent iterator
   NextSubEvent() by default delivers newly filled subevents only,
   suppressing exisiting subevents in list of non used ids.
   Subevent data field re-uses the memory allocated by libgsievent
   instead of copying it to own buffers.
   New method SetPrintEvent to set verbose mode for the next n events.
   Format changes in TGo4MbsEvent::PrintEvent().

3. Performance improvements of analysis framework in step manager,
   dynamic list and mbsevent

4. New EventInfo toolwindow to control printout of an event sample in
   remote or local terminal. Optionally the user implemented PrintEvent
   method, or the root TTree::Show output may be used. May control the
   arguments of TGo4MbsEvent::SetPrintEvent(). Supports drag and drop
   for event names from remote browser.

5. Scale values dialog window extended by zmin and zmax fields.
   Allows setting minimum and maximum thresholds for channel contents of
   2d histograms when autoscale is off.

6. Display total memory consumption of histograms and conditions at the
   end of PrintHistograms() and PrintConditions() execution, respectively.

7. TCanvas support in disk browser improved: Histograms saved inside
   a TCanvas in a root file will appear in memory browser whenever
   this canvas is displayed

8. Analysis Terminal window: Limitation of text history buffer to 100kb
   by default, may be changed in settings menu. Disabled textwrapping
   in output for scrollbars.

9. Bugfix: Doubleclick on histogram in divided viewpanel did pop up
   this histogram magnified in a new viewpanel, but did not initialize
   viewpanel colors and crosshair settings correctly.

New features in Go4 v2.6.1 (consolidation release):

1. Conservation of TLateX textfields when changing draw
   style/histogram statistics

2. Disk browser open file dialog allows multiple file selection

3. Superimpose of histograms with same name from different files
   possible if overwrite mode is deselected in memory browser.
   Histograms will be copied to memory browser with cycle numbers
   added to names.

4. Superimpose THStack does not crash anymore when deleting histograms

5. Bugfix: Crash after closing and re-opening viewpanel for same
   histogram with different subpad divisions

6. Bugfix: Analysis did stop when an analysis step without
   event processor is disabled

7. Browser items (disk, monitor, remote, memory) selectable with
   keyboard (after mousefocus or tab), return acts as doubleclick

8. Bugfix: histogram bound to condition was not fetched from analysis
   when doubleclicking on remote condition icon


New features in Go4 v2.6:

1. New Go4 Hotstart: The current setup of the GUI (analysis name and
   settings, viewpanel geometry, objects in memory and monitor browser,
   displayed objects in pads) may be saved to a hotstart script file
   (postfix ".hotstart") from the "Settings->Generate hotstart" menu.
   The script name may be passed as argument on next Go4 GUI
   startup (e.g. "Go4 mysetup"), which will launch the analysis and
   restore the settings (e.g. from file "mysetup.hotstart").

2. New class TGo4ExportManager transforms and saves root objects
   into other formats. Currently supported: plain ASCII (*.hdat, *.gdat)
   and Radware/gf3 (*.spe). An export filter is available in the GUI
   memory browser to save selected objects.

3. Example macro Go4Example2Step/convertfile.C converts all
   histograms and graphs from root file into ascii files, conserving
   the subfolder hierarchy.

4. New TGo4StepFactory class can be used as standard step factory
   to simplify the setup of analysis steps for small analyses.
   New example package Go4Example1Step shows the usage.

5. The TGo4Analysis class can now be used as standard analysis class.
   New example package Go4ExampleSimple shows the usage.

6. New viewpanel has size of previously active viewpanel.
   Default viewpanel starting size is stored in settings and recovered
   on next Go4 startup.

7. Viewpanel: Switch on/off histogram title display in options menu.

8. Viewpanel: Switch on/off crosshair for each pad in options menu.
   Default crosshair mode can be selected in main window settings menu
   and is saved/restored by Go4 settings. Crosshair mode button in
   condition editor has been removed.

9. Viewpanel: Default background  color can be selected in main window
   settings menu and is saved/restored by Go4 settings.

   resizing the canvas. Offers own palette editor in right mouse button
   popup menu.

11.Parameter editor: Added column to display the sourcecode
   comments for each parameter class member as description.

12.Condition editor: General editor has button to create a new
   condition. New condition is defined in a dialog window and is put
   into general editor. May be send to analysis for registration, or
   saved into a file then. All types of new conditions
   (window, polygon, array of these with variable size) are supported.

13.Histogram and Condition info windows: Object size now takes
   into account real data size on heap.

14.New analysis toolbar button for "re-submit and start" shortcut.
   Useful when file shall be re-read from the beginning after changing
   something in the setup.

15.Autosave may be disabled completely from analysis configuration GUI.

16.New mode for TGo4MbsFile (*.lmd) wildcard/metafile input: Auto-save file
   may change its name whenever input file is changed. Name is automatically
   derived from input filename. Old behaviour (one auto-save summing up
   all inputs) is still possible. This can be switched with method
   TGo4Analysis::SetAutoSaveFileChange(bool ).

17.End of .lmd file input gives informational message instead of
   error message.

18.Bugfix: avoid log-file crash when Go4 is started in directory without
   write access.

   memory and monitoring list update).

3. Bugfix in Go4 Mainwindow exit dialog. Exit via window "x" icon
   works properly now, too.

4. Redesign of Go4 Auto-save mechanism. Subfolders are mapped as
   TDirectories in TFile now, thus improving performance for large
   number of objects. Auto-save file is closed after each write,
   avoiding invalid file states in case of analysis crash.
   Dynamic list entries are saved as independent objects.

5. Object editors (condition, parameter, dynamic list) may save
   and load objects from/to root files.

6. Support of dynamic list entries in disk browser: Editor opens
   on double click.

7. Status messages of object editors appear in bottom status line of
   Go4 main window.

16.Dynamic list editor can change the global dynamic list interval for
   analysis.

17.Reorganisation of GUI icons.

18.Performance improvements in TTimers of Go4 kernel: Removed TurnOn/Off
   statements.

19.New method TGo4Analysis::NextMatchingObject() for search in
   analysis objects with wildcard expression.

20.Analysis: PrintHistograms(), PrintConditions() supports wildcard
   expressions for output list selection.

21.New methods: TGo4Analysis::StoreParameter, StoreCondition,
   StoreFitter, StoreFolder to write these objects into event store of
   an analysis step. Event number will be appended to object keys for
   parameter logging.

22.Consistency checks of analysis steps can be disabled by new method
   TGo4Analysis::SetStepChecking(bool). For setting up of non serial type
   analysis steps with own user management.

23.TGo4MBSEvent::PrintEvent() extended to display headers and also data
   field contents of subevents.

24.New methods: TGo4MbsEvent::GetMbsBufferHeader(),
   TGo4MbsSource::GetBufferHeader() to access the buffer headers of
   list mode files. Implemented example in Go4Example2Step.

25.Go4 GSI histogram server also exports TGraph objects as histograms
   (if possible).

26.Implementation of TGo4Condition::Paint() to display Go4 conditions
   in regular root environment. Conditions may be drawn on TPad which
   already contains a histogram. New classes for condition painters and
   condition views.

27.Reorganisation of the distribution Makefiles.


New features in Go4 v2.4:
1. New Package Go4Log to handle all messages and logfile.
   This replaces the old package Go4Trace. Static method
   TGo4Log::Message(char*, ...) can be called everywhere to
   display text on terminal and optionally write to logfile.
   Modified Go4 message prompt.
2. Header information of mbs listmode data files accessible
   by new methods s_filhe* TGo4MbsSource::GetInfoHeader()
   and s_filhe* TGo4MbsEvent::GetMbsSourceHeader()
3. Eventsource TGo4MbsRandom to deliver random spectra into
   mbs events without connection to mbs node or reading
   listmode file. Matches event structure of standard example
   Go4Example2Step.
4. TGo4Picture objects can be used in the monitoring list.
5. Changes in Analysis configuration window:
   Number of events, start/stop/skip events may be specified;
   tagfile name and optional socket timeout.
   Filebrowser for eventsource files. Autosave interval now
   re-fers to time (seconds) instead number of events.

      property of TGo4Condition and stored in autosave file.
   b. Working viewpanel pad and reference histogram of
      condition may be changed at any time.
   c. Clear counters button applies clearing to analysis
      condition immediately and refreshes editor from
      analysis.
   d. Statistics inside window condition limits
      (integral, maximum, mean, rms, etc) are calculated;
      these values are displayed in editor and may be
      drawn in labels on working pad. Methods to calculate
      statistical quantities belong to TGo4WindowCondition
      class and may be used in analysis, too.
   e. Cursor panel with crosshair mode and optional marker
      to pick values from displayed histogram.
      Cursor may be set by mouse click, by moving the
      graphical marker object, or by defining cursor
      position in the text fields. Cursor values may be
      drawn in label on working pad
   f. Extension of polygon condition/TCutG is calculated
      and shown like the borders of the window condition.
   g. Improved creation of new TCutG functionality.

   Go4 fitter in connection with the parameter mechanism
   and an ascii file database of line energies.  

13.Make full screen default for new viewpanels.

14.When updating objects in memory folder, a redraw is done
   automatically. Keyboard shortcut "Alt r" for refresh of
   local objects from analysis.

15. When monitor updates a Viewpanel, the pads are updated
   without blocking the GUI (not yet for picture).

16. Button besides zoom buttons to enter display limits by values.

17. Drag pictures from analysis pad to viewpanel possible.

18. Some buttons/icons on the browser pads have been rearranged.

New features in Go4 v2.3:
1. TGraph objects can be registered and displayed correctly.
   Reset of TGraph (clear all points) by "eraser" button
   from GUI possible.
2. Reset/clear complete folders by selecting them in
   remote browser and eraser button. New method
   ClearObjects("Histograms")  to reset all objects of
   named folder, e.g. all histograms at once.
3. Print button to printout histogram and condition lists
   with statistics in analysis terminal. These buttons
   are located in the dynamic list editor.

   from within parameter editor. Framework provides new
   class TGo4FitterEnvelope as example parameter.
   Example put into TXXXAnalysis.
5. User defined event source is possible. New class
   TGo4UserSourceParameter to be checked in analysis step
   factory for any kind of input. Example package
   Go4ExampleUserSource shows usage.
6. New class TGo4Picture to define layout of canvas with
   histograms. Pictures are registered in Go4 Pictures
   folder and stored in autosave file like histograms;
   they can be displayed in any viewpanel. Example added
   in TXXXAnalysis.
7. Possibility to register complete TCanvas objects in Go4
   Canvases folder to be saved within autosave file.
   Switch TGo4Analysis into ROOT batchmode to suppress
   drawing actions in analysis client while canvas is

   files in the same view panel now.


New features in Go4 v2.2:
1. Possibility to select rsh or ssh and analysis output in
   Xterm or GUI window.
2. Wildcard in input lmd file names.
3. Input file name beginning with @ is interpreted as text
   file containing lmd file names.
4. An autosave file can be written on demand
   (button in configuration menu).
5. Parameter editor. User parameter objects
   (subclasses of TGo4Parameter) registered in the
   analysis can be edited in the GUI by double click in
   the browser. Currently supported members are the
   primary data types and arrays of these.
6. New environment variable Go4USERLIBRARY can be set to
   a colon separated list of ROOT user libraries which
   are loaded automatically in the GUI. This is needed
   for editing parameter objects.
7. Dynamic lists. A dynamic list editor can be used to
   create/specify dynamic entries. A dynamic entry consists
   of a histogram (can be created new) and a member of
   an event object which shall be histogrammed.
   Optionally a condition can be added. The condition also
   can be created new. The event structure is expanded
   in the browser. Drag&drop is provided to select members.
8. The condition editor has been improved. Arrays are now
   handled properly. TCutGs for polygon conditions can be
   created new.
9. TGraph objects are supported like histograms.
10.In the Go4 view panel, the ROOT "event status"
   (cursor position) can be displayed.
11.The new fit GUI is available. It includes three
   different peak finders, a simple fitter, a wizard, and
   full access to all fitter components. Fitters can be
   stored/retrieved to/from files or memory.
12.User Makefile: the user executable need to be linked
   against the makefile variable $(Go4LIBS) only,
   as defined in the Makefile.config of the framework
   (see Makefile of example Go4Example2Step).
