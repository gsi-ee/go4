/**
 * Example of a user defined runnable subclass. Method Run() _must_ be implemented.
 * Methods ThreadCatch and UnexpectedCatch _can_ be overridden to change default
 * exception behaviour.
 * This runnable is able to do different actions depending on the fiMode parameter set
 * in the ctor (good for easy testing). However, the usual way is to create a dedicated
 * runnable class for a dedicated purpose and pass different
 * runnable classes to the different go4 threads (see Go4TaskHandler package for examples).
 ***********************************************************************************
 * Different actions in this runnable:
 * fiMode=0: Dummy
 *       printout a message every 5 seconds.
 * fiMode=1: Kill and create
 *       sleep 30s, then kill other threads- sleep 5s, then create other threads again
 * fiMode=2: Stop and start
 *      sleep 10s, then stop other threads- sleep 10s, then start other threads again
 * fiMode=3: Aborting all
 *       sleep 30s, then abort application by means of exception
 * fiMode=4: Histogramming
 *      creates histogram, fills it with random gaussian and draws it on pad
 *      depending on the runnable name ("Maker1", "Maker2"), different pads are used
 *      Maker 1 deletes histogram again each time, Maker 2 keeps initial histogram
 *      sleeps of 2s are used to slow down the action
 * fiMode=5: Recreator
 *       Cancel and recreate one thread by name ("First Thread") every 15 s.
 * fiMode=6: Exception tester
 *       sleep 60s, then throw different thread exceptions (latest: Restart exception)
 * fiMode=7: Histogram without drawing
 *       create histogram, fill it with random and delete it again
 *      for memory alloc tests independent from root gui
 * fiMode default: Undefined
 *      throw logic exception
 *********************************************************************************
 * NOTE1: Members of the runnable (histogram, canvas) are not deleted when the
 * TThread is killed. The runnable exists independent from the thread.
 * NOTE2: The user just has to create own runnables and a threadmanager subclasses,
 * subclassing of  TGo4Thread or other parts of the package are not required!
