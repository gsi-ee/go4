This is the README of Go4FitExample package.

Package includes several examples for Go4Fit package.

Before examples, Go4Fit package should be compiled first.
To run examples, LD_LIBRARY_PATH should include path to libGo4Fit.so library
(init_script.sh from Go4Fit can be used for that).

To compile a set of examples, in Go4FitExample directory enter:

   >make all

While Example3 is uses FORTRAN code for function calculations,
it will be compiled only when f77 and libg2c.so installed in the system.

All examples (except 3-rd one) also can be used in CINT directly.
To use them in CINT, just run root and specify macro name:

  [shell] root -l Example1.cxx

For the forth example appropriate library should be loaded first:

  [root] gSystem->Load("libExample4.so");

Detailed description of Go4Fit package can be found
on Go4 web site http://go4.gsi.de.
