# This is example of login script, required for compilation 
# of complete Go4 and user analyses under CYGWIN environment
#
# First ensure that all software components: CYGWIN, Microsoft VisualC, ROOT and Qt are installed.
#
# Qt package should be compiled with VisualC - like qt-win-opensource-4.8.2-vs2012.exe. 
# Do not try to install MinGW version - it uses unsuitable compiler version.
# Install Qt into the path without spaces.
#
# To be able use VisualC from cygwin, one should call
#  vcvarsall.bat file from the Cygwin.bat. 
#  Insert following line into Cygwin.bat before bash:
#     call E:\Soft\VC2012\VC\vcvarsall.bat"
#
#  One also must ensure that link.exe from VisualC is used. 
#  Problem description and several solutions can be found here:
#     https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Windows_build_prerequisites_using_cygwin#Fix_cygwin_path
#  Simplest solution - just delete or rename link.exe from cygwin;
#  preferable - change sequence of $PATH. 
#
#                                          
# Adjust windows paths for ROOT, Qt and Go4
