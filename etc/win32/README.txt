This package is compiled and tested under Windows XP SP2 and Windows 7
together with Microsoft Visual C++ 2012 Express Edition and CYGWIN.


1. INSTALLATION

- Run installation program. Full path name, where package is extracted,
  SHOULD NOT content any spaces. Therefore location like
  "C:\Program files" should be avoided. Default installation 
  location is "C:\Users\<username>\go4".
- After files are extracted, two sub-directories will be created:
     root - binary distribution of ROOT (see http:\root.cern.ch)
     go4  - binary distribution of Go4


2. STARTING ANALYSIS

- Run windows command prompt via main windows menu command:
    "Start/Programs/Accessories/Command prompt"
- Execute go4init.bat batch file from directory, where package was extracted:
    C:\> cd Users\user1\go4\
    C:\> call go4init.bat
- Change to directory with user analysis:
    C:\> cd go4\Go4ExampleSimple
- Start analysis by command:
    C:\Soft\go4\Go4ExampleSimple> go4analysis -server -random
- Also one can start analysis directly from the GUI


3. STARTING GUI

- Open in Windows Explorer folder, where package was extracted
- Double click on "go4.bat" script to start gui
- Main windows should appear. One can use "Connect to running server"
  button for connection with analysis, running in server mode.
- Or one can start analysis directly from the GUI via 
  "Launch analysis" menu command.    
- Go4 GUI in Windows has mostly the same functionality as in Linux 
  beside the fact that analysis cannot be started from the GUI on 
  other node as is possible under Linux via ssh


4. STARTING GO4 browser in ROOT

- Run root from command prompt after go4init.bat was called
    C:\> root
- In CINT shell instantiate TGo4Interface class
    root [0] new TGo4Interface
  All go4 classes are available in ROOT via rootmap mechanism.  
- After TGo4Interface instance is created, two variables will be accessible:
  go4 (class TGo4Interface) and br (class TGo4BrowserProxy)
- Connect to running analysis server by command like
    root [1] go4->ConnectAnalysis("lxi001",5000,0,"password");
- If connection is successful (see log output), just start ROOT
  browser by command
    root [2] new TBrowser
- In browser new Go4 folder should exists, which represent structure
  of remote analysis. Draw of histogram and picture are possible.
  Via right mouse menu monitoring flag for histograms can be switched
  on/off and monitoring can be toggled.
- Via go4 instance a various commands can be executed like:
    root [3] go4->StartAnalysis();
    root [4] go4->StopAnalysis();
  For more information see online documentation on TGo4Interface class
  on htpp://go4.gsi.de site


5. COMPILE USER ANALYSIS UNDER WINDOWS

  First of all, Microsoft VC++ should be installed.
  There is a free edition of Microsoft Visual C++ Express 2012 on
       http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/
  After VC++ is installed, there are two alternatives, 
  how example can be compiled.

  5.1. Compile analysis with CYGWIN

  First of all, CYGWIN (http://cygwin.com/) should be installed.
  This provides Unix like environment and allows to use shell-based 
  build scripts. To be able use VisualC from cygwin, one should call
  vcvarsall.bat file from the Cygwin.bat before bash is started. 
  One should add line like this:
     call E:\Soft\VC2012\VC\vcvarsall.bat"

  One also must ensure that link.exe from VisualC is used. 
  Problem description and several solutions can be found here:
     https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Windows_build_prerequisites_using_cygwin#Fix_cygwin_path
  Simplest solution - just delete or rename link.exe from cygwin;
  preferable - change sequence of $PATH. 

  After CYGWIN installed and configured, one should adjust "go4login" script, 
  specifying where ROOT, Qt and Go4 are installed. One must avoid path with spaces,
  therefore location "C:\Program Files\root" will not work.
   
  Than copy your analysis (or one of Go4 examples, for instance, Go4Example2Step) to separate location.
  To compile example:
     /cygdrive/q> . go4login
     /cygdrive/q> cd /cygdrive/f/user/app1
     /cygdrive/f/user/app1> make clean 
     /cygdrive/f/user/app1> make all
  This should compile user analysis library. To start analysis, just call:
     /cygdrive/f/user/app1> go4analysis -server -run

  5.2. Compile with Windows native nmake tool

  This method does not require CYGWIN. One should adjust go4init.bat
  (as described before) and prepare special Makefile for nmake tool.
  There is example: $GO4SYS\Go4Example2Step\Makefile.win, which
  is written for Go4Example2Step. To adopt it for other user analysis,
  one should specify correct list of source files in this Makefile. 
  To run compilation, just do:
     C:\Soft\> go4init.bat
     C:\Soft\> F:
     F:\> cd \User\App1
     F:\User\App1> nmake clean all -f Makefile.win
  Once library compiled, analysis can be started with command:
     F:\User\App1> go4analysis -server -run


6. COMPILATION OF GO4 FROM SOURCE

- Download and install root (ROOT Windows binaries are enough)
- Install and configure CYGWIN
- Install Microsoft VC++
- Install Qt 4.8.x binaries package for MS VC compiler like
    qt-win-opensource-4.8.2-vs2012.exe 
- Download go4 sources from http://go4.gsi.de web site.
- Find and modify $GO4SYS/etc/win32/go4login file to actual location of all 
  components, copy it to home cygwin directory
- Run Cygwin shell, call ". go4login", change to go4 directory and call "make"
- Hopefully, this will compile Go4 under Windows!
