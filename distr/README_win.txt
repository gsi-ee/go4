This package is compiled and tested under Windows XP SP2.

INSTALLATION:
- Extract content of binary Go4 archive. Full path name, where package
  is extracted, SHOULD NOT content any spaces. Therefore location like
  "C:\Program files" should not be used. Best if package will be extracted
  on top directory like "C:\" or "Q:\" or like that.
- After files are extracted, two top directories will be produced:
     root - binary distribution of ROOT (see http:\root.cern.ch)
     go4  - binary distribution of Go4
- Correct pathes to ROOT and Go4 installation should be set in
  go4login.bat init script.

STARTING ROOT:
- Run windows command prompt via main windows menu command:
    "Start/Programs/Accessories/Command prompt"
- Change to directory, where package was extracted
- Execute go4init.bat batch file
    Q:\> go4init.bat
- Start ROOT by command
    Q:\> root
- All Go4 classes will be accessible in CINT via ROOT map mechanism.

STARTING GO4 browser in ROOT
- Run root like described before
- In CINT shell instantiate TGo4Interface class
    root [0] new TGo4Interface
- After that two variables will be accessible:
  go4 (class TGo4Interface) and br (class TGo4BrowserProxy)
- Connect to running analysis server by command like
    root [1] go4->ConnectAnalysis("lxi001",5000,0,"password");
- If cunnection is succesfull (see log output), just start ROOT
  browser by command
    root [2] new TBrowser
- In browser new Go4 folder should exists, which represent structure
  of remote analysis. Draw of histogram and picture are possible.
  Via right mouse menu monitoring flag for histograms can be switched
  on/off and monitorring can be toggled.
- Via go4 instance a various commands can be executed like:
    root [3] go4->StartAnalysis();
    root [4] go4->StopAnalysis();
  For more information see online documentation on TGo4Interface class
  on htpp://go4.gsi.de site

COMPILE USER ANALYSIS UNDER WINDOWS
  First of all, Microsoft VC++ should be installed.
  There is a free edition of Microsoft Visual C++ Express 2005 on
       http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/
  Also appropriate version of MS SDK should be installed.
  Some more instructions how it is can be installed see on ROOT web page:
       http://root.cern.ch/root/Procedure/
  After VC++ is installed, there are two alternatives, how example can be compiled.
1. Compile with CYGWIN
  Here first CYGWIN (http://cygwin.com/) should be installed.
  This provides Unix like enviroment and allows us to use build scripts,
  which are widely used in Go4 building procedure. After CYGWIN installed, one of
  Go4 examples (for instance, Go4Example2Step) should be copied to separate
  location and modified to specific user requirememnts. The only modification
  of Makefile is required: GO4SYS should be set as RELATIVE path to Go4
  installation. For instance, if Go4 in F:\Apps\go4 and user analysis in
  F:\User\App1, GO4SYS should be "..\..\Apps\go4". Note, that GO4SYS, which is
  set in command prompt enviroment, should not be changed.
  To run compilation, change in Windows command prompt to
  user code directory and run bash like:
     F:\User\App1> bash
  And than starts make
     bash-3.00$ make
  This should compile example and produce library and executables.
2. Compile with Windows native nmake.exe tool
  This requires to have special Makefile, which is suited for nmake.exe
  tool. There is one example: $GO4SYS\Go4Example2Step\Makefile.win, which
  is written for Go4Example2Step. To addopt it to any other user analysis,
  one should specify correct list of source files in this Makefile. To run
  compilation, just do:
     F:\User\App1> nmake -f Makefile.win

COMPILATION OF GO4 FROM SOURCE:
  To compile Go4 from source on Windows, several step should be done.
  1. Download and install root (ROOT Windows binaries is enough)
  2. Install and configure Cygwin
  3. Configure VC++ as described in http://root.cern.ch/root/Procedure/
  4. Download go4 sources from http://go4.gsi.de web site.
  5. Specify correct GO4SYS and ROOTSYS (in windows style
     like "C:\go4" and "C:\root")
  6. Set GO4_OS = Win32 in $GO4SYS/Makefile.config file.
  7. Run make from Cygwin.
  8. Hopefully, this will compile Go4 under Windows!
