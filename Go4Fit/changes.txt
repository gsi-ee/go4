History of Go4Fit package changes.

19.11.2002
  First public release. v. 1.0.

01.2003
  Relase of v. 1.1. Changes since last release:
   1.  TGo4FitDataIter iterator class introduced. All data content access routins were moved from TGo4FitData
       objects to iterators.
   2.  All fitting actions now can be done without buffers allocation for data and models. It saves memory,
       but may consume a lot of time.
   3.  More clear mechanizm of buffers usage is introduced. Fitter SetMemoryUsage() routine now
       sets usage of buffers mode : (0) without any buffers, (1) only for data objects, (2) for both data and models objects,
       (3) explicit setup for each data and models (SetUseBuffers() routine).
   4.  Draw() and EstimateAmplitudes() methods of fitter now can be called out of
       Initialize()/Finalize() scopes.
   5.  CreateResult() method of fitter renamed to CreateDrawObject() method and several new
       parameters introduced. Also can be called in any place.
   6.  If Draw() creates and shows more than one histogram, they all placed to THStack.
   7.  All examples (except 3-rd) now can be run from CINT.
   8.  ROOTPeakFinder() and PeakFinder() methods introduced.
   9.  New AddH1(), AddPolynoms(), AddGauss1() methods of fitter were intoduced. They implement frequently
       used operations for fitter.
   10. Error concerning integration of model fixed.
   11. Fitter streamer corrected for case, when the same object was assigned to several different slots.
   12. Error in Streamer for TGo4FitComponent fixed. File format is changed.
   13. Problem when deleting data or model object with owned object in slot fixed.
   14. ProcessObjects() routine was added. It process a list of objects at once and creates either a list of fitters
       or list of TVectorD objects with result values. Optionally list of rows (parameters) names and list of
       columns (processed data) names can be obtained.
   15. Axis calibration objects now called axis transformation object. This gives an ability introduce more complex axis
       transformation(s).

Release with Go4 v2.1

02.2003
   1. TGo4FitSlotList class introduced. It provides a common set of operation for working
      with list of slots. Inherited by basic TGo4FitterAbstract & TGo4FitComponent classes/
      Syntax of SetObject and ClearObject commands slightly changed.
   2. One slot can be now connected to another. This means, that both slots will operatr with
      same object, assigned to one of them. A complex chain of slots can be created (ring of
      connected slots not allowed).
   3. Data object now automatically discard usage of buffers, if any of it's axis
      transformation objects has variable parameters.
   4. Error in TGo4FitModelFormula fixed. Names of parameters were not correctly replaced
      in expression for TFormula.
   5. All models parameters can be renamed. All models objects detect meaning of parameter
      via index. Names of parameters are used for displaying and in TGo4FitModelFormula class.
   6. For TGo4FitModelFormula & TGo4FitModelFunction objects some of parameters can be
      specified as position or width. This is may be usefull in GUI when displaying position
      and width of lines.

03.2003
   7. Two function add: GetResultFF() & GetResultNDF(). They return result value of fit
      function and number of degrees of freedom, which were achived last time when actions
      were executed.
   8. Fixed problem with saving fitter with/without objects.
   9. All functions concerning buffers allocations and usage for data and model objects are
      moved to protected scope. User can only specify buffers usage mode in fitter or for explicit
      data and model objects. Buffers will be used only in actions execution.
   10.New TGo4FitPeakFinder action created. It contains all setup and fuinction for three
      different peak finders (by S.Linev(1), ROOT TSpectrum(2), H.Essel(3)). This action can
      be added to actions list, but to execute this action DoActions(kTRUE) should be called.
      This parameters allows to change fitter components in actions. See also Example11.
   11.Each of model components now has group index. Model components with same index can be draw
      simultaniously with fitter->Draw("data1,Group0") command. The index = 0 (default for polynoms)
      is reserved to mark backfround components. To show background fitter->Draw("data1,Background")
      can be used. For rest model components default value for index is -1.
   12.Implementation of custom streamers changed. This is done to support standard
      ROOT version scheme.

Release with Go4 v2.2

   1. Fixed error in DataRidge object. Now Example13 shows usage of data ridge object.


31.03.2003
   Released as separate package with version number 2.0

10.2004
   1. New method TGo4Fitter::CalculatesIntegral is added. It allows calculation of
      integrals and counts sum for data objects and model components.
   2. Add .rootmap generation to Makefile of Go4Fit & Go4FitExample packages.
      After map generated, there is no need to explicitly load fit libraries
      in CINT session.

06.2007
   Bug fix in TGo4FitModelFunction with loading of dynamic libraries.
   
08.2007
   1. Bug fix with fixed parameters handling
   2. New method TGo4Fitter::CloneModel() to clone any model component.
