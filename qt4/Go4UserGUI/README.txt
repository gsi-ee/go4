I. How to setup standard example outside $GO4SYS directory?

1. Create a working directory for project (e.g. $HOME/UserGUI)

2. Copy in it content of the $(Go4SYS)/Go4UserGUI directory

3. Compile gui in new location by
      make clean
      make all

4. Set GO4USERGUI variable to location, where user gui is istalled.
   For instance:
    
       export GO4USERGUI=$HOME/UserGUI
      
   This directory should contain library with name libGo4UserGui.so.
   If name of library was changed, it should be specified in 
   GO4USERGUI variable:
     
       export GO4USERGUI=$HOME/UserGUI/libAlternativeUserGui.so

5. If you want to use any classes from external libraries in 
   the user gui, you need to set the GO4USERLIBRARY variable to let
   these libraries be loaded.

   For example, if the user gui works with a Go4 parameter class that
   is defined for a user analysis at $HOME/UserAnalysis directory,
   the set up would be:

        export GO4USERLIBRARY=$GO4SYS/lib/libGo4Analysis.so:$HOME/UserAnalysis/libGo4UserAnalysis.so

   NOTE that the Go4 analysis library libGo4Analysis.so needs to be specified
   here as well, because it is not linked to the Go4 GUI by default.


6. Now run main go4 gui. Use "Tools/User GUI" menu item 
   to activate new user gui. If settings was specified wrong,
   standard example will be used.
 
II. How to edit example in qt designer?

   Most of *.ui files inside go4 (including user gui) contains 
   special go4 classes, which does not known by Qt designer.
   To view and modify these classes in designer, special plugin 
   should be created.

   For that in $GO4SYS directory call:
   
   shell>  make plugin
   
   This will create libgo4plugin.so library in $GO4SYS/Go4plugin directory.
   This file should be copied to $QTDIR/plugins/designer directory 
   (this may require root privileges).

III. How to modify standard example?

   There are several limitations, which should be kept in mind:

1. User main widget should always be inherited from QGo4Widget class.
   This class provide interface to functionality of main go4 gui.
   
2. User gui library should always include StartUserGui(void*)
   function, which called by main gui once when library is loaded.
   This function should create main user widget and return its pointer
   back. In provided example this function situated in the beginning
   of QUserPanel.cpp file.
