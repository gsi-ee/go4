/**
*   Timer with main purpose to block the root
*   TApplication loop during thread execution. Moreover,
*   this timer calls Initialization() function of threadmanager,
*   which can be overridden by user to define any actions which should not
*   be run within a thread (critical root system calls, like opening TServerSocket,
*   should be done within the application loop, i.e. in the timer).
*   In threadmanager non-blocking-mode, Initialization() is called from timer
*   regularly with the period specified in threadmanager; in blocking mode
*   it is called once after each threadmanager UnBlockApp().
*   This timer is also responsible for proper termination of the threadmanager.
